# Spaceguard

**Update:** A new version is under development! Check it out at [bigblackcode.github.io](http://bigblackcode.github.io/). 

SpaceGuard is a simple canvas game made in Vanilla JavaScript. 
 
The original purpose of this repository was to experiment with the graphic APIs of the browsers and the implementation of simple game mechanics and animation.
